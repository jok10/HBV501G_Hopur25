\section{Use Case Document}

\subsection{Add Songs to a Playlist [UC1]}
\textbf{Primary Actor:} User

\textbf{Preconditions:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The user must be logged into the system.
  \item The user must have a playlist that has already been created.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Success Guarantee:}  
The song selected by the user is added to the playlist.

\textbf{Main Success Scenario:}  
The user opens a playlist that already exists. They select the ``add song'' option. They search for a song (see UC4) and select it. The system adds the song to the playlist and confirms successful addition.

\textbf{Extensions / Alternate Scenarios:}  
If the song is already in the playlist, the system displays ``This song has already been added to the playlist.''

\textbf{Miscellaneous / Open Issues:}  
Possibility to add multiple songs at once.

\subsection{Search Song [UC2]}
\textbf{Primary Actor:} User

\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item None
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Success Guarantee:}  
The system returns relevant songs matching the userâ€™s search criteria.

\textbf{Main Success Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The user selects the ``search'' option.
  \item The user enters a search query (song name, artist, or both).
  \item The system searches the music database.
  \item The system displays a list of matching songs.
  \item The user can view details of a selected song.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extensions / Alternate Scenarios:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If no results are found, the system displays ``No songs found.''
  \item If the search query is empty, the system prompts the user to enter a valid search term.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Miscellaneous / Open Issues:}  
Consider supporting advanced search filters (e.g., album, genre, release year).

\subsection{Brief Use Cases}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Brief Use Case 1 [UC5]}: The user is able to generate a link to share their playlist with friends, family, and the community.}
    \item{\textbf{Brief Use Case 2 [UC6]}: ...}
\end{itemize}
