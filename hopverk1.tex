\section*{2. Use Cases}

\subsection*{Fully Dressed Use Case}

\textbf{Name:} UC1 -- Add songs to a playlist

\textbf{Primary Actor:} User

\textbf{Preconditions:} 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item The user must be logged into the system. 
  \item The user must have a playlist that has already been created.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Success Guarantee:}  
The song selected by the user is added to the playlist.

\textbf{Main Success Scenario:}  
The user opens a playlist that already exists. They select the ``add song'' option. They search for a song (as described in brief UC4) and select it. The system adds the song to the playlist and gives a confirmation that the song has been successfully added.

\textbf{Extensions / Alternate Scenarios:}  
If a song has already been added to the playlist, the system displays ``this song has already been added to the playlist.''

\textbf{Miscellaneous / Open Issues:}  
Possibility to add multiple songs at once.

\subsection*{Brief Use Cases}

\textbf{Name:} UC4 -- Search Song  

\textbf{Primary Actor:} User  

\textbf{Precondition:} User must be logged into the system.  

\textbf{Trigger:} User selects the ``search'' option.  

\textbf{Main Success Scenario:}  
The user enters a search query (song name, artist, or both). The system displays a list of matching songs. The user can view details of a selected song.  

\textbf{Success Guarantee:}  
The system returns relevant songs that match the search criteria.  

\textbf{Extensions / Alternate Scenarios:}  
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item If no results are found, the system displays ``No songs found.''
  \item If the search query is empty, the system prompts the user to enter a valid search term.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Miscellaneous / Open Issues:}  
Consider supporting advanced search filters (e.g., by album, genre, release year).

\textbf{Name:} UC5 -- Sharing Playlists
